# lolanalyze
scrapes data off lolalytics for further analysis

Lolalytics.com is a website used by players of League of Legends to find champion winrates, build paths, and matchup statistics. The plan with this repo is to scrape large amounts of data and find either what champions/items/lane performs the best, as well as finding builds that are unconventional (off-meta).

based off the script written by user Khorn89, found here https://github.com/khorn89/LolAlytics.py/blob/master/LoLAlytics.py
